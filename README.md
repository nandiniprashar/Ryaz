### **1. Introduction**

#### 1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to build an “Online Examination System” to ease the generation of questions papers for Student’s End Semester Examination and then will view to authenticate users.

#### 1.2. Document Conventions
| Shortend | Full Stand |
|----------|------------|
| OTA | Over The Air | 
| db | DataBase |
| ID | Identity Card |
| E-R | Entity Relationship |

#### 1.3. Intended Audience and Reading Suggestion
This project is a prototype for the Online Student Examination OTA and it is restricted within school/college premises. This has been implemented under our team members’ practices. This project is useful for the teachers as well as the mother-nature.

#### 1.4. Project Scope
- Admin can only registered new account and each users can be log in into their existing account.
- Entry for each question papers will be much easier.
- Only authenticated user can view the question papers.
- Teachers and Examiner both can view the question paper but only teachers can generate question papers.
- Reduces the uses of hardcopy of papers.

#### 1.5. Definitions and Acronyms
- There will be a risk if the question papers shall see by the students before examination.
- Students can see the question paper only when they get the authenticated User ID and Password.

### **2. Overall Description**

#### 2.1. Product Perspective
A distributed Online Student Examination database System stores the following information:
- **User details:**
It includes the username, password and user-type fields for registering and log in authenticated users.
- **Department details:**
It includes the department-name field that describe the departments of the students. 
- **Semester Details:**
It includes the semester-name field that describe at which semester the student is studying.
- **Subject Details:**
It includes the subject-name, subject-code, semester-name, and department-name fields that detailed the subjects allotted to students according to their department-name and semester-name.
- **Question Paper Description:**
It includes subject-code, paper-id, maximum-marks, semester-name, year fields. The subject-code describe that from which subject, the question belongs. The paper-id tells the unique identity of question papers. The maximum-marks tells the maximum marks that student can get by solving the given question paper. The semester-name and year tells the question paper belongs to which semester and year of students respectively.
- **Questions Details:**
It includes paper-id, parts (divisions of single question paper), questions and marks (marks per question) fields. 

#### 2.2. User Class and Characteristics
- **The examiner (user) should be able to do following functions:**
    - Can only view the question papers if they are authenticated by the administrator.
- **The teacher (user) should be able to do following functions:**
    - Can add question papers.
    - Can set question papers.
    - Can view question papers.
    - Can update question papers.
    - Can delete question papers.
- **The administrator (user) should be able to do following functions:**
    - Can registered new users as authenticated users.
    - Can delete authenticated users.
    - Can view any question papers.

#### 2.3. Operating Environment
- Client/Server system.
- Operating System: Windows10.
- Database: MySQL.
- Platform: JavaScript, PHP.

#### 2.4. Design and Implementations Constraints
- The global schema.
- SQL commands for queries/applications.
- Implement the database at least using a centralized database management system.

### **3. System Features**
- It is fast and much accurate.
- It is also needed less manpower to execute the examination.
- It saves student time in examination.
- It also helps the environment by saving papers.
- Only administration can only registered new account and each users can be log in into their existing account
- Only authenticated user can view the question paper, not students.
- Only teachers can generate question papers.

### **4. System Requirements**

#### 4.1. External Interface Requirements

##### 4.1.2. User Interfaces
- **Front-end Software:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Back-end Software:** PHP, MySQL.
- **Browser** that support CGI, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

##### 4.1.2. Hardware Interfaces
- **Processor:** Above Pentium4.
- **Operating System:** Windows/Linux/MAC.

##### 4.1.3. Software Interfaces
| **Software Used** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Operating System | We have chosen Windows operating system for its best support and user-friendliness. |
| Database | To save records of the user, questions, and subjects, we have used MySQL db. |
| Server-Side Scripting | To perform database operation through scripting at server-side, we use PHP language. |
| Front-End Languages | To design an interactive front-end, we use HTML (for structuring the application), CSS (for styling the HTML structure) and JavaScript (for interactive webpages). |

##### 4.1.4. Communication Interfaces
The project support all type of web browsers. We are using simple and user-friendly communication interfaces.

#### 4.2. Other Requirements

##### 4.2.1. Performance Requirements
- **E-R Diagram:**
The E-R Diagram constitutes a technique for representing the logical structure of a database in a pictorial manner. This analysis is then used to organize data as a relation and finally obtaining a relation database.
Entities specify distinct real-world items in an application.
Attributes/Properties specifies properties of an entity and relationships.
Relationships connect entities and represent meaningful dependencies between them.
- **Normalization:**
The basic objective of normalization is to reduce redundancy which means that information is stored only once. Storing information several times leads to wastage of storage space and increase in the total size of the data stored. The normalization is the process of breaking down a table into smaller tables.

##### 4.2.2. Safety Requirements
If there is extensive damage to a wide portion of the database due to catastrophic failure, such as a disk crash, the recovery method restores a past copy of the database that was backed up to archival storage and reconstructs a more current state by reapplying or redoing the operations of committed transactions from the backed up log, up to the time of failure.

##### 4.2.3. Security Requirements
Security systems need database storage just like many other applications. However, the special requirements of the security market mean that vendors must choose their database partner carefully.
